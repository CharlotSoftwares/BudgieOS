# BudgieOS

BudgieOS is an operating system for x86-compatible computers, which is currently being developed by Charlot Softwares.

Its kernel, most drivers, and many programs are written entirely in [FASM](https://flatassembler.net/) assembly language, making them very compact and lean on system resources.

Based on [MenuetOS](https://www.menuetos.net/) and [KolibriOS](https://www.kolibrios.org/, it uses its own standards and is NOT fully POSIX or UNIX compliant.
